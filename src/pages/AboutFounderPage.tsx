            Hi, Iâ€™m [Founderâ€™s Name], the visionary behind Dunia Safari Tours.
            My passion for connecting people through authentic travel 
            experiences inspired me to create journeys that celebrate Moroccoâ€™s
            culture, beauty, and spirit. With years of experience in [tourism /
            travel / hospitality], I believe travel is more than movement â€” 
            itâ€™s a way to bond, learn, and grow.

            The Journey
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Dunia Safari was founded with a simple belief: travel should be
            authentic, affordable, and unforgettable. From the busy souks of
            Marrakech to the quiet dunes of the Sahara, I wanted to curate
            experiences that immerse visitors in the real Morocco. Every package
            is designed with care, balancing adventure, culture, and comfort.

            My Vision
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            My vision is to make Morocco accessible to everyone â€” whether
            youâ€™re a football fan traveling for AFCON 2025, a solo explorer, or
            a group looking for a tailored experience. Dunia Safari is not just
            about tours, itâ€™s about creating lifelong memories and building
            connections between cultures.
